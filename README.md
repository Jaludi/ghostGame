# Updates
The game is currently in Beta mode. I'm planning on releasing it this March.

# About the game
This is my first Andriod Game ever. It is an infinate flapper game. The diffuclty increases over time. I'm using Unity3d to create it. I'm using assertions and encapsulation to protect game from hacks and exploitation.

# How to play
Click your screen to flap and fly higher. Avoid hitting the ground and flying rocks or your ghost will perish. The longer you last the more score you get. Collide into the Coin increase your score.

# Installation

Add the APK file to your phone.
